The below is class which implements `__next__`as if it was a function using the `yield` keyword:
"""


class FirstHundredGenerator(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.number = 0

    def __next__(self):
        if self.number < 100:
            current = self.number
            self.number += 1
            return current
        else:
            raise StopIteration()


gen = FirstHundredGenerator()
next(gen)  # 0
next(gen)  # 1

"""
Notice how the object, with its property, remembers what the value of `self.number` is at all points in time.

This object is called in Python a generator because every time the next number is available not because it’s in a sequence, but because it is generated from its current state (in this case, by adding 1 to `self.number`).

All objects that have this `__next__` method are called iterators. All generators are iterators, but not the other way round.

For example, you could have an iterator on which you can call `next()`, but that doesn’t generate its values. Instead, it could take them from a list or from a database.

*Important*: iterators are objects which have a `__next__` method.

Here’s an example of an iterator which is not a generator:
"""


class FirstFiveIterator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        self.i = 0

    def __next__(self):
        if self.i < len(self.numbers):
            current = self.numbers[self.i]
            self.i += 1
            return current
        else:
            raise StopIteration()


"""
As you can see it’s returning numbers that are not being generated; instead they’re being returned from a list.

If we run this code though, we will get an error:

"""

sum(FirstHundredGenerator())  # comment this line out to run the rest of the file.

"""
Similarly if we run this code:
"""

for i in FirstHundredGenerator():
    print(i)

"""
And that’s because in Python, an `iterator` and an `iterable` are different things. You can iterate over an `iterable`. The iterator is used to get the next value (either from a sequence or generated values).

> You can iterate over iterables, not over iterators.
