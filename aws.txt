AWS

Aws regions
        aws availability zones ( 3 min, 6 max, usually 3)


EC2 -> regional service
IAM -> global service

IAM -> Identity and access management
      users
      groups
      roles
policies written in JSON


IAM federation -> for big enterprise -> SAML standard

One IAM user per physical person
One IAM role per application


EC2

capability of
1) renting virtual machines (EC2)
2) storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
3) distributing load across machines( ELB)
4) Scaling the services using auto-scaling group(ASG)

Steps
AMI -> amazon machine image -> instance type t2.micro -> configuration -> storage -> tags -> security group

AMI -> Built for specific AWS Region

pem file permission -> chmod 400

security group -> inbound and outbound -> acting as firewall
                can be to multiple instances
                locked down to a region /VPC combination

elastic IP -> its a public ipv4 own as long as we don't delete it
                  max 5 elastic in a account

EC2 User data (runs with root user ) -> bootstrapping our instances -> launching commands when machine starts
              copy your shell script to user data field

EC2 Launch types -> on demand instances -  short workload , predictable pricing
                    reserved - (minimum 1 year or 3 year )
                            reserved instances - 75% discount
                            convertible reserved instances  - 54% discount
                            scheduled reserved instances  -
                    Spot instances - 90% discount ( can loose at any point of time ) - use if workloads are resilient to failure
                    dedicated instances -> no other customers can share this hardware. only for u , no control in placement
                    dedicated hosts -> Physical dedicated ec2 server , full control of ec2 instance placement , 3 year period reservation

ENI -> ELastic network interface -> Bounded to specific Availability zone
        logical component in VPC - represent a virtual network card
        primary ipv4, one or more secondary ipv4
        one elastic ipv4
        one public ipv4
        one or more security groups
        a mac address


EC2 Pricing -> Price per hour varies on
            region
            Instance type
            on-demand vs spot vs dedicated vs reserved
            linux vs windows vs private OS
Billed by second with min. of 60 seconds. If instanced stopped no payment
others factors are storage, load balancing etc etc

EC2 types based on -> RAM, CPU , I/O , Network , GPU
          M instances are balanced in everything No GPU
          T2, T3 are burstable instances (ok CPU performance). uses burst credits(CPU credits) -> all credits used-> CPU bad

For exam->
• Know how to SSH into EC2 (and change .pem file permissions)
• Know how to properly use security groups
• Know the fundamental differences between private vs public vs elastic IP
• Know how to use User Data to customize your instance at boot time
• Know that you can build custom AMI to enhance your OS
• EC2 instances are billed by the second and can be easily created and thrown away, welcome to the cloud!
